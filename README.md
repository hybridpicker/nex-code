## Ollama Cloud — The Free-by-Default Model Tier

nex-code was built with Ollama Cloud as its primary provider. No subscription, no billing surprises.
Use powerful open models like **Qwen3 Coder**, **Kimi K2.5**, **Devstral**, and **DeepSeek R1** for free.

| Model | Context | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| `qwen3-coder:480b` | 131K | Code generation, tool calling |
| `kimi-k2.5` | 256K | Large repos, reasoning |
| `devstral-2:123b` | 131K | Reliable tool calling |
| `devstral-small-2:24b` | 131K | Fast, efficient |
| `qwen3.5:35b-a3b` | 256K | MoE, very fast |

Switch anytime: `/model ollama:qwen3-coder:480b` or add your `OLLAMA_API_KEY` to `.env`.

---

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- At least one API key **or** a local [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) server

### Install from npm

```bash
npm install -g nex-code
```

Or run directly without installing:

```bash
npx nex-code
```

### Install from source (for contributors)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hybridpicker/nex-code.git
cd nex-code
npm install
npm run build         # Build the high-performance bundle
cp .env.example .env
npm link
npm run install-hooks
```

### Configure a Provider

Create a `.env` file in your project directory (or set environment variables):

```bash
# Pick any — only one is required
OLLAMA_API_KEY=your-key       # Ollama Cloud (Qwen3 Coder, Qwen3.5, DeepSeek R1, Devstral, Kimi K2.5, Llama 4, MiniMax M2.5, GLM 4.7)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key       # OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o1, o3, o4-mini)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key    # Anthropic (Claude Sonnet 4.6, Opus 4.6, Haiku 4.5)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key       # Google Gemini (3.1 Pro Preview, 2.5 Pro/Flash, 2.0 Flash)
# No key needed for local Ollama — just have it running
```

### Verify

```bash
cd ~/any-project
nex-code
```

You should see the banner, your project context, and the `>` prompt.

---

## Usage

```
> explain the main function in index.js
> add input validation to the createUser handler
> run the tests and fix any failures
> refactor this to use async/await instead of callbacks
```

### Try These Scenarios

**Understand an unfamiliar codebase:**
```
> give me an overview of this project — architecture, key files, tech stack
> how does authentication work here? trace the flow from login to session
> find all API endpoints and list them with their HTTP methods
```

**Fix bugs with context:**
```
> the /users endpoint returns 500 — find the bug and fix it
> tests are failing in auth.test.js — figure out why and fix it
> there's a memory leak somewhere — profile the app and find it
```

**Add features end-to-end:**
```
> add rate limiting to all API routes (100 req/min per IP)
> add a /health endpoint that checks DB connectivity
> implement pagination for the GET /products endpoint
```

**Refactor and improve:**
```
> refactor the database queries to use a connection pool
> this function is 200 lines — break it into smaller functions
> migrate these callbacks to async/await
```

**DevOps and CI:**
```
> write a Dockerfile for this project
> set up GitHub Actions CI that runs tests on push
> add a pre-commit hook that runs linting
```

**Multi-step autonomous work (YOLO mode):**
```bash
nex-code -yolo
```
```
> read the entire src/ directory, run the tests, fix all failures, then commit
> add input validation to every POST endpoint, add tests, run them
> upgrade all dependencies to latest, fix any breaking changes, run tests
```

The agent decides autonomously whether to use tools or just respond with text. Simple questions get direct answers. Coding tasks trigger the agentic tool loop.

### YOLO Mode

Skip all confirmation prompts — file changes, dangerous commands, and tool permissions are auto-approved. The banner shows a `⚡ YOLO` indicator. Toggle at runtime with `/autoconfirm`.

---

## Providers & Models

Switch providers and models at runtime:

```
/model                         # interactive model picker (arrow keys + Enter)
/model openai:gpt-4o           # switch directly
/model anthropic:claude-sonnet
/model gemini:gemini-2.5-pro
/model local:llama3
/providers                     # see all available providers & models
```

| Provider | Models | Env Variable |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **ollama** | Qwen3 Coder, Qwen3.5 (397B, 122B-A10B, 35B-A3B, 27B, 9B, 4B, 2B, 0.8B), DeepSeek R1, Devstral, Kimi K2.5, MiniMax M2.5, GLM 4.7, Llama 4 | `OLLAMA_API_KEY` |
| **openai** | GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o1, o3, o4-mini | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| **anthropic** | Claude Sonnet 4.6, Opus 4.6, Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 4.5, Sonnet 4 | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| **gemini** | Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview, 2.5 Pro/Flash, 1.5 Pro/Flash | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| **local** | Any model on your local Ollama server | (none) |

Fallback chains let you auto-switch when a provider fails:
```
/fallback anthropic,openai,local
```

## Features

### Compact Output
The agent loop uses a single spinner during tool execution, then prints compact 1-line summaries:
```
  ⠋ ▸ 3 tools: read_file, grep, edit_file
  ✓ read_file src/app.js (45 lines)
  ✓ grep TODO → 12 matches
  ✗ edit_file src/x.js → old_text not found
```

After multi-step tasks, a résumé and context-aware follow-up suggestions are shown:
```
  ── 3 steps · 8 tools · 2 files modified · 37s ──
  💡 /diff · /commit · /undo
```
Step counts match between inline `── step N ──` markers and the résumé. Elapsed time is included. Read-heavy sessions (analysis, status checks) suggest `/save · /clear` instead.

When the model runs tools but produces no visible text, an automatic nudge forces it to summarize findings — preventing silent completions where the user sees nothing.

### Response Quality
The system prompt enforces substantive responses: the model always presents findings as formatted text after using tools (users only see 1-line tool summaries). Responses use markdown with headers, bullet lists, and code blocks. The model states its approach before non-trivial tasks and summarizes results after completing work.

### Performance
- **Asynchronous I/O**: The entire CLI is built on non-blocking I/O. File reads, writes, and git operations never block the main thread, keeping the UI responsive even during heavy tasks.
- **Fast Startup**: Pre-bundled with `esbuild` to minimize module loading overhead, achieving sub-100ms startup times.
- **In-Memory Indexing**: A background indexing engine (using `ripgrep` or a fast fallback) keeps project file paths in RAM for instant file discovery, path auto-fixing, and glob searches.

### Streaming Output
Tokens appear live as the model generates them. Braille spinner during connection, then real-time line-by-line rendering via `StreamRenderer` with markdown formatting and syntax highlighting (JS, TS, Python, Go, Rust, CSS, HTML, and more).

### Paste Detection
Automatic bracketed paste mode: pasting multi-line text into the prompt is detected and combined into a single input. A `[Pasted content — N lines]` indicator is shown with a preview of the first line. The user must press Enter to send — pasted content never auto-fires. The paste handler stores the combined text and waits for explicit submission.

### Ctrl+C Cancellation
Pressing Ctrl+C during a running request immediately cancels the active HTTP stream and returns to the prompt:
- An `AbortController` signal flows from the readline SIGINT handler through the agent loop to the provider's HTTP request
- All providers (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, local) destroy the response stream on abort
- No EPIPE errors after cancellation (stdout writes are EPIPE-guarded)
- During processing: first Ctrl+C aborts the task and returns to prompt; second Ctrl+C force-exits
- At the idle prompt: first Ctrl+C shows `(Press Ctrl+C again to exit)`, second Ctrl+C exits (hint resets after 2 s)
- readline intercepts Ctrl+C on TTY (`rl.on('SIGINT')`) to prevent readline close → `process.exit(0)` race

### Diff Preview
Every file change is shown in a diff-style format before being applied:
- **Header**: `⏺ Update(file)` or `⏺ Create(file)` with relative path
- **Summary**: `⎿  Added N lines, removed M lines`
- **Numbered lines**: right-justified line numbers with red `-` / green `+` markers
- **Context**: 3 lines of surrounding context per change, multiple hunks separated by `···`
- OOM-safe: large diffs (>2000 lines) fall back to add/remove instead of LCS
- All changes require `[y/n]` confirmation (toggle with `/autoconfirm` or start with `-yolo`)

### Auto-Context
On startup, the CLI reads your project and injects context into the system prompt:
- `package.json` — name, version, scripts, dependencies
- `README.md` — first 50 lines
- Git info — branch, status, recent commits
- `.gitignore` content
- **Merge conflicts** — detected and shown as a red warning; included in LLM context so the agent avoids editing conflicted files

### Context Engine
Automatic token management with compression when the context window gets full. Tracks token usage across system prompt, conversation, tool results, and tool definitions.

### Safety Layer
Three tiers of protection:
- **Forbidden** (blocked): `rm -rf /`, `rm -rf .`, `mkfs`, `dd if=`, fork bombs, `curl|sh`, `cat .env`, `chmod 777`, reverse shells — 30+ patterns
- **Dangerous** (requires confirmation): `git push`, `npm publish`, `rm -rf`, `docker rm`, `sudo`, `ssh` — 14 patterns
- **SSH read-only safe list**: Common read-only SSH commands (`systemctl status`, `journalctl`, `tail`, `cat`, `git pull`, etc.) skip the dangerous-command confirmation
- **Path protection**: Sensitive paths (`.ssh/`, `.aws/`, `.env`, credentials) are blocked from file operations
- **Pre-push secret detection**: Git hook scans diffs for API keys, private keys, hardcoded secrets, SSH+IP patterns, and `.env` leaks before allowing push
- **Post-merge automation**: Auto-bumps patch version on `devel→main` merge; runs `npm install` when `package.json` changes

### Sessions
Save and restore conversations:
```
/save my-feature
/load my-feature
/resume              # resume last session
```
Auto-save after every turn.

### Memory
Persistent project memory that survives across sessions:
```
/remember lang=TypeScript
/remember always use yarn instead of npm
/memory
/forget lang
```

Also loads `NEX.md` from project root for project-level instructions.

### Plan Mode
Analyze before executing — the agent explores the codebase with read-only tools, produces a structured plan, then you approve before any changes are made:
```
/plan refactor the auth module   # enter plan mode
/plan status                     # show plan progress
/plan approve                    # approve and exit plan mode (all tools re-enabled)
/auto semi-auto                  # set autonomy level
```
Plan mode is **hard-enforced**: only read-only tools (`read_file`, `list_directory`, `search_files`, `glob`, `grep`, `web_search`, `web_fetch`, `git_status`, `git_diff`, `git_log`, `git_show`, `ask_user`) are available. Any attempt to call a write tool is blocked at the API level — the LLM cannot make changes even if it tries. The plan text is saved to `.nex/plans/current-plan.md` for review.

### Undo / Redo
In-session undo/redo for all file changes (write, edit, patch):
```
/undo                # undo last file change
/redo                # redo last undone change
/history             # show file change history
```
Undo stack holds up to 50 changes. `/clear` resets the history.

### Task Management
Create structured task lists for complex multi-step operations:
```
/tasks                # show current task list
/tasks clear          # clear all tasks
```
The agent uses `task_list` to create, update, and track progress on tasks with dependency support.

When the agent creates a task list, a **live animated display** replaces the static output:
```
✽ Adding cost limit functions… (1m 35s · ↓ 2.6k tokens)
  ⎿  ✔ Create cli/picker.js — Interactive Terminal Picker
     ◼ Add cost limits to cli/costs.js
     ◻ Add budget gate to cli/providers/registry.js
     ◻ Update cli/index.js
     ◻ Run tests
```
- Animated spinner header with elapsed time and cumulative token count
- Per-task status icons: `✔` done, `◼` in progress, `◻` pending, `✗` failed
- Automatically pauses during text streaming and resumes during tool execution
- Falls back to the static `/tasks` view when no live display is active

### Sub-Agents
Spawn parallel sub-agents for independent tasks:
- Up to 5 agents run simultaneously with their own conversation contexts
- File locking prevents concurrent writes to the same file
- Multi-progress display shows real-time status of each agent
- Good for: reading multiple files, analyzing separate modules, independent research

**Multi-Model Routing** — Sub-agents auto-select the best model per task based on complexity:
- **Read/search/list** tasks → fast models (essential tier)
- **Edit/fix/analyze** tasks → capable models (standard tier)
- **Refactor/implement/generate** tasks → most powerful models (full tier)

The LLM can also explicitly override with `model: "provider:model"` in the agent definition. When multiple providers are configured, the system prompt includes a routing table showing all available models and their tiers.

### Git Intelligence
```
/commit              # analyze diff, suggest commit message
/commit feat: add login
/diff                # show current diff summary
/branch my-feature   # create and switch to branch
```

### Permissions
Control which tools the agent can use:
```
/permissions         # show current settings
/allow read_file     # auto-allow without asking
/deny bash           # block completely
```

Persisted in `.nex/config.json`.

### Cost Tracking
Track token usage and costs per provider:
```
/costs
/costs reset
```

### Cost Limits
Set per-provider spending limits. When a provider exceeds its budget, calls automatically fall back to the next provider in the fallback chain:
```
/budget                    # show all limits + current spend
/budget anthropic 5        # set $5 limit for Anthropic
/budget openai 10          # set $10 limit for OpenAI
/budget anthropic off      # remove limit
```

Limits are persisted in `.nex/config.json`. You can also set them directly:
```json
// .nex/config.json
{
  "costLimits": {
    "anthropic": 5,
    "openai": 10
  }
}
```

### Open-Source Model Robustness

Four features that make Nex Code significantly more reliable with open-source models:

**Tool Call Retry with Schema Hints** — When a model sends malformed tool arguments, instead of a bare error, the agent sends back the expected JSON schema so the model can self-correct on the next loop iteration.

**Smart Argument Parsing** — 5 fallback strategies for parsing tool arguments: direct JSON, trailing comma/quote fixes, JSON extraction from surrounding text, unquoted key repair, and markdown code fence stripping (common with DeepSeek R1, Llama).

**Tool Argument Validation** — Validates arguments against tool schemas before execution. Auto-corrects similar parameter names (Levenshtein distance), fixes type mismatches (string↔number↔boolean), and provides "did you mean?" suggestions.

**Auto-Fix Engine** — Three layers of automatic error recovery that silently fix common tool failures:
- **Path auto-fix**: Wrong extension? Finds the right one (`.js` → `.ts`). File moved? Globs for it by basename. Double slashes, missing extensions — all auto-resolved.
- **Edit auto-fix**: Close match (≤5% Levenshtein distance) in `edit_file`/`patch_file` is auto-applied instead of erroring. Stacks with fuzzy whitespace matching.
- **Bash error hints**: Enriches error output with actionable hints — "command not found" → install suggestion, `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` → `npm install <pkg>`, port in use, syntax errors, TypeScript errors, test failures, and more.

**Stale Stream Recovery** — Progressive retry strategy when streams stall (common with large Ollama models after many agent steps):
- 1st retry: 3s backoff delay, resend same context (handles transient stalls)
- 2nd retry: force-compress conversation (~80k tokens freed), 5s delay, retry with smaller context
- Last resort: if retries exhausted, one final force-compress + reset for fresh attempts
- Broader context-too-long detection catches Ollama-specific error formats (`num_ctx`, `prompt`, `size`, `exceeds`)

**Tool Tiers** — Dynamically reduces the tool set based on model capability:
- **essential** (5 tools): bash, read_file, write_file, edit_file, list_directory
- **standard** (13 tools): + search_files, glob, grep, ask_user, git_status, git_diff, git_log, task_list
- **full** (17 tools): all tools

Models are auto-classified, or override per-model in `.nex/config.json`:
```json
{
  "toolTiers": {
    "deepseek-r1": "essential",
    "local:*": "essential",
    "qwen3-coder": "full"
  },
  "maxIterations": 100
}
```

`maxIterations` sets the agentic loop limit project-wide (default: 50). The `--max-turns <n>` CLI flag overrides it per run.

Tiers are also used by sub-agent routing — when a sub-agent auto-selects a model, its tool set is filtered to match that model's tier.

## Skills

Extend Nex Code with project-specific knowledge, commands, and tools via `.nex/skills/`.

### Prompt Skills (`.md`)
Drop a Markdown file and its content is injected into the system prompt:

```markdown
<!-- .nex/skills/code-style.md -->
# Code Style
- Always use semicolons
- Prefer const over let
- Use TypeScript strict mode
```

### Script Skills (`.js`)
CommonJS modules that can provide instructions, slash commands, and tools:

```javascript
// .nex/skills/deploy.js
module.exports = {
  name: 'deploy',
  description: 'Deployment helper',
  instructions: 'When deploying, always run tests first...',
  commands: [
    { cmd: '/deploy', desc: 'Run deployment', handler: (args) => { /* ... */ } }
  ],
  tools: [
    {
      type: 'function',
      function: { name: 'deploy_status', description: 'Check status', parameters: { type: 'object', properties: {} } },
      execute: async (args) => 'deployed'
    }
  ]
};
```

### Management

```
/skills                    # list loaded skills
/skills enable code-style  # enable a skill
/skills disable code-style # disable a skill
```

Skills are loaded on startup. All enabled by default. Disabled skills tracked in `.nex/config.json`.

---

## MCP

Connect external tool servers via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io):

```json
// .nex/config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

```
/mcp              # show servers and tools
/mcp connect      # connect all configured servers
/mcp disconnect   # disconnect all
```

MCP tools appear with the `mcp_` prefix and are available to the agent alongside built-in tools.

---

## Hooks

Run custom scripts on CLI events:

```json
// .nex/config.json
{
  "hooks": {
    "pre-tool": ["echo 'before tool'"],
    "post-tool": ["echo 'after tool'"],
    "pre-commit": ["npm test"]
  }
}
```

Events: `pre-tool`, `post-tool`, `pre-commit`, `post-response`, `session-start`, `session-end`.

### Agentic Loop

```
User Input --> [AbortController created]
    |
[System Prompt + Context + Memory + Skills + Conversation]
    |
[Filter tools by model tier (essential/standard/full)]
    |
Provider API (streaming + abort signal) --> Text tokens --> rendered to terminal
    |                   \--> Tool calls --> parse args (5 strategies)
    |                                       |
    |                              [Validate against schema + auto-correct]
    |                                       |
    |                              Execute (skill / MCP / built-in)
    |                                       |
    |                              [Auto-fix: path resolution, edit matching, bash hints]
    |
[Tool results added to history]
    |
Loop until: no more tool calls OR 50 iterations OR Ctrl+C abort
```

## Performance

Nex Code v0.3.7+ includes comprehensive performance optimizations:

| Optimization | Improvement | Impact |
|--------------|-------------|--------|
| **System Prompt Caching** | 4.3× faster | 77µs → 18µs |
| **Token Estimation Caching** | 3.5× faster | Cached after first call |
| **Context File Caching** | 10-20× faster | 50-200ms → 5-10ms |
| **Debounced Auto-Save** | 0ms in hot path | Saves after 5s inactivity |
| **Tool Filter Caching** | 1.7× faster | Cached per model |
| **Schema Cache** | 3.4× faster | 2.51µs → 0.73µs |

**Average speedup:** 2.7× (micro-benchmarks)  
**Real-world improvement:** ~10× faster per turn

Run benchmarks yourself:
```bash
node benchmark.js
```
